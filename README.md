This is a repository gathering some LISA data tutorials based on the LISA Data Challenge datasets and codes.

## Description
The tutorials are python jupyter notebooks.

## Installation

1. Use the following link to access the Google Colab notebooks (preferably with Google Chrome):
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1N2J7HQZdrB9VUgNIhCNN_lpjJ6ZNmf6M
2. Save the notebook on your own Google Drive (File / Save a copy in Drive )
3. Run the notebook cells in order by clicking on the read buttons or by pressing SHIFT + ENTER. The first four cells do all the work of installing the LDC software stack and downloading challenge files.

## Additional material

* the LDC source codes and data sets can be found on the [LDC website](https://lisa-ldc.lal.in2p3.fr/ldc) after creating an account. 
* another tutorial on massive black hole binary data can be run on the same Google Colab session after the previous one has been run:
